Hey!

This is my submission for the [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0)!

The limits of the jam were pretty loose: work alone, any engine allowed -> so of course I didn't use one !

Everything besides the rendering engine was made during the jam, which includes but is not limited to: resource managment, sprite rendering, playing sounds, scene managment, post processing, input handling

The source code is barely readable but thats fine, if it works it works right ^^

Special thanks to my girlfriend for the inspiration and mental support, I honestly couldn't have dont it without her.
